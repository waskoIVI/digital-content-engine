    <h3>Welcome to the Digital Content Engine (DCE)!</h3>

    The DCE is a Jahia content repository and RESTful API that delivers Marriott and Vistana property and property-related information to a variety of consuming applications. As well, the DCE delivers content managed "structured" data.

    Calls are processed through Mashery. All endpoints are HTTPS only and are subject to rate limiting rate limiting (by both queries per second and queries per day).

                    <h3>HVAC Replacement: through December 2019</h3>

                    <p>The resort has a project underway to upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system in the villa buildings. The project began in 2018 and will continue throughout 2019. Villa buildings may be occupied during this time; work will be limited to unoccupied villas.</p>

                    <h3>Hospitality Tax and Environmental Tax</h3>

                    <p>The State of Quintana Roo assesses a hospitality tax that is due upon checkout.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <h3>Check Cashing Policy</h3>

                    <p>Personal checks are not accepted at the resort, but we are able to cash travelers checks at the Front Desk.</p>

                    <h3>Check-in/Check-out</h3>

                    <p>We invite you to check in after 4&nbsp;p.m., and request that you check out before 10 a.m. local time. However, if your arrival or departure does not coincide with our schedule, the Front Desk will be happy to receive your bags while you enjoy the surrounding resort facilities.</p>

                    <p>Consecutive reservations may require moving villas from stay to stay. Reservations will be placed in the villa type listed on your confirmation. Please make arrangements with the front desk for assistance with your luggage on the day that your new reservation begins.</p>

                    <p>Owners, is someone else enjoying your villa or do you need to make other changes to your reservation? Be sure to contact <a href="https://www.vistana.com/contact-us" target="_blank">Owner Services</a> and provide your guest&rsquo;s name prior to their arrival to authorize their check-in or any other modification to your reservation. Rental by a VSN&nbsp;Owner of units reserved using StarOptions (other than a vacation period at your Home Resort) is prohibited. Violation may result in the suspension of an Owner&rsquo;s right to reserve within VSN&nbsp;until compliant. External exchange guests should contact their external exchange company to obtain a guest certificate if someone else will be checking in. Please also let us know if you&rsquo;re checking in after your scheduled arrival date, so we can plan properly.</p>

                    <p>For security purposes, keys will only be given to the name on the reservation. You will be asked to provide a valid government or state-issued photo ID at check in.</p>

                    <h3>Concierge Services</h3>

                    <p>To ensure you have a memorable vacation with us, a designated personal Concierge is available to assist you.

                    <p>The system will hold these funds until check-out. Please note that credit card charges will appear in the local currency, Mexican pesos (MXN).</p>

                    <h3>Cribs, Highchairs and Additional Bedding</h3>

                    <p>Rollaway beds, cribs and other special request items are limited in supply and are fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis. Charges apply for rollaway beds and some other special request items. Rollaway beds are limited to one per villa and are not available in the studio premium villa due to space limitations.</p>

                    <p>For special requests, please contact Owner Services up to 24 hours in advance of your arrival. External exchange guests should contact the resort directly to place request these items.

                    <h3>Currency Policy</h3>

                    <p><strong>Currency Fluctuations</strong><br />
                    For non-U.S. hotels, rates confirmed in USD may be converted to local currency by the hotel at your time of stay, based on the exchange rate used by the hotel and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Credit card charges are subject to additional currency conversions by banks or credit card companies, which are not within the hotel&rsquo;s control and may impact the amount charged to your credit card. Please contact the hotel if you have any questions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Restrictions on the Acceptance of U.S. Currency</strong><br />
                    Due to local regulations, the acceptance of U.S. dollars in cash is now restricted across Mexico. Payments with credit/debit cards remain unaffected. Please provide arrangements to settle your accounts and other expenses with a credit card or in Mexican pesos. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause our guests. Please check with the Concierge for the location of a bank where currency can be exchanged.</p>

                    <p>Resort dining and shopping outlets are unable to accept payment in U.S. dollars. Purchases at these outlets may be paid with credit card or Mexican pesos, or charged to your folio.</p>

                    <p>While exploring the local area, Members/Owners and guests are recommended to pay with credit card or Mexican pesos, as most local businesses will not accept payment in U.S. dollars.</p>

                    <h3>Early Departure &ndash; Owners</h3>

                    <p>Should you check out prior to your confirmed departure date, the unused portion of your reservation will be forfeited. StarOptions are not refunded for late arrival or early departure. External exchange guests should contact their external exchange company for information on early departure.</p>

                    <h3>Grocery Services</h3>

                    <p>To have your villa prestocked with groceries, beverages and other necessities, contact the resort <a href="mailto:concierge@westinlagunamar.com" target="_blank">Concierge</a> prior to your arrival.</p>

                    <h3>Housekeeping Policy &ndash; Owners</h3>

                    <p><strong>Seven nights or more:</strong> For your comfort, your villa will receive a mid-week refresher if you are staying for at least seven nights. If you are staying for more than a week, an additional housekeeping service will be scheduled during the check-in process. This will also apply to external exchange guests.</p>

                    <p><strong>Less than seven nights:</strong> Midweek service is not provided for stays less than seven nights.</p>

                    <p><strong>Additional Housekeeping Services:</strong> Additional housekeeping services, including daily service, are available. Please arrange directly with the resort prior to your arrival. Fees apply.</p>

                    <p><strong>Housekeeping Fees:</strong> A charge will be automatically applied to your villa folio for the second or more reservations (based on transaction date not arrival date) within a single Use Year associated with a single Vacation Ownership Interest.</p>

                    <h3>Internet Services</h3>

                    <p>Complimentary Internet access is available in your villa and throughout the resort. The Business Center also offers Internet, computer, printing and faxing services (fees apply).</p>

                    <h3>Parking</h3>

                    <p>Complimentary self parking and valet parking are available at the resort.</p>

                    <h3>Pet Policy</h3>

                    <p>To ensure your comfort and safety, and to maintain the quality of your villa, our vacation ownership resorts do not allow pets on the resort grounds or in the villas, with the exception of service animals.</p>

                    <h3>Smoking Policy</h3>

Designated smoking areas are provided throughout the resort. Violation of this smoking policy may result in a nonrefundable US$200 fee charged to your folio.</p>

                    <h3>Special Requests</h3>

                    <p>The Westin Lagunamar Ocean Resort Villas &amp; Spa does not accept special requests for view, specific floor or specific villa number location. The resort will make every effort to fulfill your other requests, but requests are subject to availability and therefore not guaranteed. Special requests should be placed more than 24 hours in advance of your arrival.</p>

                    <p>Unforeseen events or circumstances beyond our control may result in last-minute changes. As a result, villa assignment or special requests will only be confirmed during the check-in process.</p>

                    <p>Changes to the arrival or departure date or to villa type (other than releasing one side of the lockoff for reservations confirmed during the Home Resort Reservation Period) will result in a loss of priority for fulfilling special requests.</p>

                    <h3>Marriott Bonvoy benefits</h3>

                    <p>Marriott Bonvoy&trade; Points may be earned for qualified charges at the resort. As a villa property, we are unable to offer select Marriott Bonvoy&trade; Member benefits for ownership reservations, including complimentary room upgrades, Suite Night Awards&trade;, priority late check-out, Your24&trade;, and Gold Elite and Platinum Elite welcome gifts.</p>

                    <h3>Transportation and Shuttle Service</h3>

                    <p>Our Concierge will contact you prior to arrival to help arrange your transportation needs, whether you prefer to catch the resort shuttle or rent a car. Once at the resort, there are many ways to get around the city, including public buses and hotel shuttles, which are an easy and convenient way to navigate Canc&uacute;n.</p>

                    <h3>RESORT RECOVERY &mdash; UPDATED JUNE 2019:</h3>

                    <p>We are delighted to welcome Owners and Guests back to the beautiful paradise on St. John after our extended closure to recover from hurricane damage suffered in 2017. Prior to your arrival, we want to make you aware of some changes to the resort. While we welcomed our first Guests in early January, recovery work will be ongoing through the end of July 2019. Until then, Guests can anticipate seeing containers, some heavy equipment and workers throughout the resort. Thank you for your patience while we put the final touches on the resort. All villa buildings are open and fully functional.</p>

                    <h3>NOW OFFERING THREE CHECK-IN FACILITIES:</h3>

                    <p>You may choose to check in at the Westin<sup>&reg;</sup> reception lounge at the airport on St. Thomas, and if you have registered for the Westin ferry, the staff will accept your bags and transport them directly to the resort. The resort check-in facilities are located on the first floor of the administrative building (formerly where the gift shop was located) and at the Marina Front Desk, located dockside. See the Check-In section for additional information.</p>

                    <h3>NEW SUN TERRACE (anticipated completion in late July):</h3>

                    <p>The former reception building area is being converted to an open-air sun terrace with Wi-Fi, equipped with umbrellas, outdoor furniture and tables and chairs for Guests to enjoy.</p>

                    <h3>RESORT AMENITIES:</h3>

                    <p>The tennis courts will not reopen until June 2019, with two of the tennis courts being converted to a multiuse court. The multiuse court and four pickleball courts reopened on May 31. The resort&rsquo;s Main Pool, outdoor whirlpool spa and pool deck are open. Both the upper and lower Iguana pools are open and available for Guests of the Virgin Grand phase to enjoy. All water sports amenities are available, with complimentary nonmotorized water sport activities. (Fees apply for snorkeling equipment). Spa services are available in our spa rooms, your villa, the beachside gazebo and the poolside cabanas. The WestinWORKOUT<sup>&reg;</sup> Fitness Studio is open with cardio equipment, weight equipment and TRX training equipment.</p>

                    <h3>TRANSPORTATION:</h3>

                    <p>Both car rental services and taxis are available on St. John and at the resort. If you plan to rent a car, we recommend that you do so on St. John as the car barges running between St. Thomas and St. John are fewer and smaller than prior to the storm. See the Transportation section for additional information.</p>

                    <h3>FOOD AND BEVERAGE:</h3>

                    <p>Snorkels now offers three meals daily, serving breakfast from 7&ndash;10&nbsp;a.m., lunch from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 4&nbsp;p.m. and dinner from 5&ndash;9&nbsp;p.m. It is the only operational restaurant on property. Mango Deli has reopened in its original location and offers breakfast sandwiches, lunch fare and sundries. <a href="https://owner.vistana.com/services/genstore_categories.jsp?propertyId=17&amp;shoppingTypeId=1" target="_blank">Villa prestock service</a> is now available from Mango Deli. There are many restaurants at nearby Cruz Bay, or if you prefer to prepare your meals in the privacy of your villa, the local markets are fully stocked.</p>

                    <h3>ISLAND RECOVERY:</h3>

                    <p>While the island is ready for guests, there are still some services that have not fully recovered, including health services. Currently, the on-island medical clinic is open at the site of the former hillside clinic. The clinic is temporarily hosted in containers and offers clean, modern equipment and services. The hospital on St. Thomas operates in a very limited capacity. To contact the on-island medical clinic, contact the resort Front Desk. If you are planning to visit the resort and have concerns about medical issues, we recommend that you subscribe to an air ambulance evacuation plan. Contact Owner Services for the names of independent vendors who offer air ambulance evacuation plans from the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI).</p>

                    <h3>DINING AND ACTIVITY PAYMENT:</h3>

                    <p>Please note that all outlets for food and beverage purchases and resort activities operate cashless. See Currency and Check Cashing Policy for additional information.</p>

                    <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL/INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACT FEE:</h3>

                    <p>The USVI government assesses a US$25 per-night, per-villa Environmental/Infrastructure Impact Fee to vacation ownership Guests, as implemented in 2016. This fee is based on the villa being occupied and will be added to the Guest folio at check-out.</p>

                    <h3>SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h3>

                    <p><strong>Resort Recovery &mdash; Updated June 2019</strong><br />
                    We are delighted to welcome Owners and Guests back to the beautiful paradise on St. John after our extended closure to recover from hurricane damage suffered in 2017. Prior to your arrival, we want to make you aware of some changes to the resort. While we welcomed our first Guests in early January, recovery work will be ongoing through the end of July 2019. Until then, Guests can anticipate seeing containers, some heavy equipment and workers throughout the resort. Thank you for your patience while we put the final touches on the resort. All villa buildings are open and fully functional.</p>

                    <p><strong>Now offering three check-in facilities:</strong><br />
                    You may choose to check in at the Westin<sup>&reg;</sup> reception lounge at the airport on St. Thomas, and if you have registered for the Westin ferry, the staff will accept your bags and transport them directly to the resort. The resort check-in facilities are located on the first floor of the administrative building (formerly where the gift shop was located) and at the Marina Front Desk, located dockside. See the Check-In section for additional information.</p>

                    <p><strong>New Sun Terrace (anticipated completion in late July):</strong><br />
                    The former reception building area is being converted to an open-air sun terrace with Wi-Fi, equipped with umbrellas, outdoor furniture and tables and chairs for Guests to enjoy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Resort Amenities:</strong><br />
                    The tennis courts will not reopen until June 2019, with two of the tennis courts being converted to a multiuse court. The multiuse court and four pickleball courts reopened on May 31. The resort&rsquo;s Main Pool, outdoor whirlpool spa and pool deck are open. Both the upper and lower Iguana pools are open and available for Guests of the Virgin Grand phase to enjoy. All water sports amenities are available, with complimentary nonmotorized water sport activities. (Fees apply for snorkeling equipment). Spa services are available in our spa rooms, your villa, the beachside gazebo and the poolside cabanas. The WestinWORKOUT<sup>&reg;</sup> Fitness Studio is open with cardio equipment, weight equipment and TRX training equipment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Transportation:</strong><br />
                    Both car rental services and taxis are available on St. John and at the resort. If you plan to rent a car, we recommend that you do so on St. John as the car barges running between St. Thomas and St. John are fewer and smaller than prior to the storm. See the Transportation section for additional information.</p>

                    <p><strong>Food and Beverage:</strong><br />
                    Snorkels now offers three meals daily, serving breakfast from 7&ndash;10&nbsp;a.m., lunch from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 4&nbsp;p.m. and dinner from 5&ndash;9&nbsp;p.m. It is the only operational restaurant on property. Mango Deli has reopened in its original location and offers breakfast sandwiches, lunch fare and sundries. <a href="https://owner.vistana.com/services/genstore_categories.jsp?propertyId=17&amp;shoppingTypeId=1" target="_blank">Villa prestock service</a> is now available from Mango Deli. There are many restaurants at nearby Cruz Bay, or if you prefer to prepare your meals in the privacy of your villa, the local markets are fully stocked.</p>

                    <p><strong>Island Recovery:</strong><br />
                    While the island is ready for guests, there are still some services that have not fully recovered, including health services. Currently, the on-island medical clinic is open at the site of the former hillside clinic. The clinic is temporarily hosted in containers and offers clean, modern equipment and services. The hospital on St. Thomas operates in a very limited capacity. To contact the on-island medical clinic, contact the resort Front Desk. If you are planning to visit the resort and have concerns about medical issues, we recommend that you subscribe to an air ambulance evacuation plan. Contact Owner Services for the names of independent vendors who offer air ambulance evacuation plans from the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI).</p>

                    <p><strong>Dining and Activity Payment:</strong><br />
                    Please note that all outlets for food and beverage purchases and resort activities operate cashless. See Currency and Check Cashing Policy for additional information.</p>

                    <p><strong>Environmental/Infrastructure Impact Fee:</strong><br />
                    The USVI government assesses a US$25 per-night, per-villa Environmental/Infrastructure Impact Fee to vacation ownership Guests, as implemented in 2016. This fee is based on the villa being occupied and will be added to the Guest folio at check-out.</p>

                    <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>

                    <p>We are committed to making our facilities, amenities and services accessible to guests with disabilities. Accessibility features in your villa are guaranteed only if confirmed during the reservation process and indicated on your confirmation.</p>

                    <h3>CANCELLATION POLICY &ndash; OWNERSHIP RESERVATONS</h3>

                    <p>Vistana Signature Network<sup>&trade;</sup> reservations made during the Home Resort Reservation Period or the VSN Float Period are subject to the following cancellation policy and may be cancelled by calling Owner Services prior to the arrival date of the assigned reservation. Failure to cancel a confirmed reservation prior to the arrival date will prevent the restoration of StarOptions for further use.</p>

                    <p>Reservations may be cancelled 61 days or greater prior to arrival with no cancellation fee or Usage Restriction.</p>

                    <p>Reservations made 60 days or less prior to arrival may be cancelled through the following day after making the reservation (before the end of hours of operation, Eastern Time) with no cancellation fee or Usage Restriction.

Subsequent usage will be restricted to reservations within 60 days of the new requested arrival date for that Use Year and will not be eligible for StarOptions Banking or points conversion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cancellation fees:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                     <li><strong>60 days &ndash; 8 days:</strong> US$50 cancellation fee</li>
                     <li><strong>7 days or less:</strong> US$75 cancellation fee</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Reservations not affiliated with the Vistana Signature Network may be subject to cancellation fees or use restrictions. Please contact <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">Owner Services</a> to inquire about the cancellation policy that applies to your reservation. External exchange guests should contact their external exchange company for the applicable cancellation policy.</p>

                    <h3>CURRENCY AND CHECK CASHING POLICY</h3>

                    <p>While your final folio can be settled at the front desk using cash, travelers check, or credit card, please note that the resort&rsquo;s activities and food and beverage outlets operate on a cashless basis. All purchases and payment for services may be paid using a credit card or charged directly to your villa folio.</p>

                    <p>We regret that personal checks are not accepted. However, traveler&rsquo;s checks can be cashed at the Front Desk.</p>

                    <h3>CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT</h3>

                    <p>After your flight lands and your luggage is collected at baggage claim, proceed to the Westin airport reception desk to drop off your luggage and complete your check-in process. We invite you to check-in after 4 p.m., and request that you check-out before 10 a.m. local time. However, if your arrival or departure does not coincide with our schedule, the Front Desk will be happy to hold your bags while you enjoy the surrounding resort facilities.</p>

                    <p>Please note that if your stay is comprised of multiple reservations with different Villa types or phases, you will need to change villas for each reservation. We recommend that you coordinate with the bellman to collect your luggage when you vacate the villa at 10 a.m. Luggage will then be stored and delivered to your new villa when it is ready at 4&nbsp;p.m.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="https://owner.vistana.com/services/diamond.jsp?propertyId=17" target="_blank">Diamond Lane</a> makes check-in a breeze. To provide a smooth, quick and easy check-in experience for you, we invite you to fill out our <a href="https://owner.vistana.com/services/diamond.jsp?propertyId=17" target="_blank">Diamond Lane check-in form</a>. Submit it at least seven days prior to your scheduled and confirmed arrival date, and we will be better prepared to welcome you. Guests who have provided arrival information through the Diamond Lane are welcome to use the Westin airport reception desk to check-in.</p>

                    <p>Owners, is someone else enjoying your villa? Be sure to contact <a href="https://www.vistana.com/contact-us" target="_blank">Owner Services</a> and provide your guest&rsquo;s name prior to their arrival to authorize their check-in. Rental by a VSN Owner of units reserved using StarOptions (other than a vacation period at your Home Resort) is prohibited. Violation may result in the suspension of an Owner&rsquo;s right to reserve within VSN until compliant. External exchange guests should contact their external exchange company to obtain a guest certificate if someone else will be checking in. Please also let us know if you&rsquo;re checking in after your scheduled arrival date, so we can plan properly.</p>

                    <p>For security purposes, keys will only be given to the name on the reservation. You will be asked to provide a valid government or state-issued photo ID at check-in.</p>

                    <h3>CONCIERGE SERVICES</h3>

                    <p>The Concierge will contact you approximately two weeks prior to your stay to offer assistance with planning your vacation activities. Should you need to assistance, please email the <a href="mailto:concierge@westinstjohnvillas.com" target="_blank">Concierge</a>. Please be sure to include the guest name, reservation number and arrival date.</p>

                    <h3>CREDIT CARD DEPOSIT POLICY</h3>

                    <p>Credit card will be authorized for incidentals upon check in. The authorization will hold the funds until check out, at which time the amount actually incurred during the stay will be charged. Authorized amounts may take up to 30 days after departure to be released by your bank or financial institution and the hotel will not be responsible for any resulting fees or charges.</p>

                    <h3>EARLY DEPARTURE &ndash; OWNERS</h3>

                    <p>Should you check-out prior to your confirmed departure date, the unused portion of your reservation will be forfeited. Home Options and StarOptions are not refunded for late arrival or early departure.</p>

                    <h3>HOUSEKEEPING POLICY &ndash; OWNERS</h3>

                    <p><strong>Seven nights or more: </strong>For your comfort, your villa will receive a restorative mid-week refresher if you are staying for at least seven nights.

                    <h3>SPECIAL REQUESTS</h3>

                    <p>We are happy to accept any special request and will fulfill any that we can; however, requested items and villa assignment requests are not guaranteed.</p>

                    <p><strong>In-Villa Items </strong><br />
                    If you find that you forgot something or if you are traveling with little ones, just let us know. While we do have cribs and high chairs available, these are limited in supply and not guaranteed. Charges may also apply for some items. To make arrangements, Owners and external exchange Guests should contact the resort directly. The Westin St. John Resort &amp; Villas does not offer rollaway beds. Most villas are equipped with a sleeper sofa.</p>

                    <p><strong>Villa Assignment </strong><br />
                    Owners may place any special request related to villa assignment, but there is no guarantee that requests can be met. Special requests requiring additional Home Options or StarOptions cannot be fulfilled by the resort. Please contact Owner Services for assistance. Villa assignment and special request fulfilment will not be confirmed until the check-in process. Home Resort reservations will be placed in the phase owned. VSN reservations may be placed in any phase offering the villa type and occupancy reserved.</p>

                    <p>Special requests should be placed more than 24 hours in advance of your arrival. Changes to the arrival or departure date, or to Villa type (other than releasing one side of the lock-off for reservations made on weekly VOI ownership and confirmed during the Home Resort Reservation Period), will result in a loss of priority for fulfilling special requests.</p>

                    <p>Please note, reservations confirmed during the Home Resort Reservation Period do not guarantee specific floor, building, or villa number assignment. Additionally, reservations made using StarOptions do not guarantee phase, view, floor, building, or villa number assignment, even for Home Resort Owners.</p>

        Returns an activities list for a specific property.

      parameters:
        - in: path

            A "propertyid" can be many things:

            1. A Vistana property code (string): code
            2. A Starwood property id (integer): propertyID
            3. A Sun sysytem id: propertyIDSun
            4. A Marriott MARSHA code: marshaCode

            In the case of the code or propertyIDSun, since these are common, there are convenienecs built in to the API where you only need to use the values: /svv or /15.

            In the case of the propertyID or marshaCode, the syntax for use is /propertyID: 5607 or /marshaCode:MCOLS

            You may also use the specific key value for all queries, /code:svv, /propertyID:5607, /propertyIDSun:15, /marshaCode:MCOLS

            A "propertyid" can be many things:

            1. A Vistana property code (string): code
            2. A Starwood property id (integer): propertyID
            3. A Sun sysytem id: propertyIDSun
            4. A Marriott MARSHA code: marshaCode

            In the case of the code or propertyIDSun, since these are common, there are convenienecs built in to the API where you only need to use the values: /svv or /15.

            In the case of the propertyID or marshaCode, the syntax for use is /propertyID: 5607 or /marshaCode:MCOLS

            You may also use the specific key value for all queries, /code:svv, /propertyID:5607, /propertyIDSun:15, /marshaCode:MCOLS

            A "propertyid" can be many things:

            4. A Marriott MARSHA code: marshaCode

            In the case of the code or propertyIDSun, since these are common, there are convenienecs built in to the API where you only need to use the values: /svv or /15.

            In the case of the propertyID or marshaCode, the syntax for use is /propertyID: 5607 or /marshaCode:MCOLS

            You may also use the specific key value for all queries, /code:svv, /propertyID:5607, /propertyIDSun:15, /marshaCode:MCOLS

            A "propertyid" can be many things:

            1. A Vistana property code (string): code
            2. A Starwood property id (integer): propertyID
            3. A Sun sysytem id: propertyIDSun
            4. A Marriott MARSHA code: marshaCode

            In the case of the code or propertyIDSun, since these are common, there are convenienecs built in to the API where you only need to use the values: /svv or /15.

            In the case of the propertyID or marshaCode, the syntax for use is /propertyID: 5607 or /marshaCode:MCOLS

            You may also use the specific key value for all queries, /code:svv, /propertyID:5607, /propertyIDSun:15, /marshaCode:MCOLS
